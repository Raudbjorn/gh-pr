2. **Token Management System**
   - Custom token support via `--token` flag or environment variables
   - Token validation and expiration checking
   - Permission verification before executing commands
   - Support for classic PATs, fine-grained tokens, and GitHub App tokens

3. **Rich Terminal UI**
   - Beautiful formatting using Rich library
   - Progress spinners for long operations
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Markdown rendering in comments

4. **Smart Caching**
   - Disk-based caching with TTL

   - Manual cache clearing option

5. **Export Capabilities**
   - Export to Markdown, CSV, or JSON formats
   - Structured output for analysis

6. **Clipboard Support**
   - WSL2-aware clipboard detection
   - Automatic ANSI stripping for plain text
   - Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/macOS)

7. **Configuration System**
   - TOML-based configuration files
   - Global and project-specific settings
   - Default preferences management

## Architecture

### Project Structure
```
gh-pr/
├── src/gh_pr/
│   ├── auth/          # Token and permission management
│   ├── core/          # GitHub API and business logic
│   ├── ui/            # Display and formatting
│   ├── utils/         # Utilities (cache, clipboard, config, export)
│   └── cli.py         # Main CLI interface
├── bin/gh-pr          # Executable wrapper
├── pyproject.toml     # Package configuration
└── install.sh         # Installation script
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns into distinct modules for maintainability
2. **PyGithub Integration**: Used established library for GitHub API interactions
3. **Click Framework**: Leveraged Click for robust CLI with help generation
4. **Rich Library**: Enhanced terminal output with modern formatting
5. **Type Hints**: Added throughout for better IDE support and documentation

## Installation

The tool can be installed using the provided `install.sh` script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment and sets up the executable wrapper.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Auto-detect PR
gh-pr

# Interactive selection
gh-pr -i

# With custom token
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxx gh-pr 123

# Export to markdown
gh-pr --export markdown

# Check permissions before operations
gh-pr --resolve-outdated
```

## Features Not Yet Complete

While the core structure is in place, some features need additional implementation:

1. **GraphQL Integration**: Some operations (resolve threads, accept suggestions) require GraphQL API
2. **Real-time Updates**: Webhook support for live PR updates
3. **Plugin System**: Architecture is ready but plugins not yet implemented
4. **Desktop Notifications**: Framework in place but not connected

## Token Features

The new token management system provides:
- Automatic token discovery (environment vars, gh CLI)
- Token type detection (classic/fine-grained/app)
- Expiration monitoring with days remaining
- Permission checking before operations
- Clear error messages for permission issues

## Additional Enhancements

Beyond the original bash script functionality:
- Shows count of open PRs in repository
- Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
- Progress indicators for all network operations
- Plain text export for clipboard compatibility
- Configuration file support for preferences
- Batch operations preparation

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.9+**: Modern Python with type hints
- **Click**: CLI framework
- **PyGithub**: GitHub API client
- **Rich**: Terminal formatting
- **diskcache**: Persistent caching
- **tomli/tomli-w**: TOML configuration

## Testing Recommendations

To fully test the implementation:
1. Install using `./install.sh`
2. Set up a GitHub token
3. Try auto-detection in a repo with PRs
4. Test filtering options
5. Verify clipboard functionality
6. Test export features

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture allows for easy extension:
- GraphQL API integration for missing features
- TUI mode with Textual
- Multi-repo support
- Custom filter plugins
- Integration with other tools
