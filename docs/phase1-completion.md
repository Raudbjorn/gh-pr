# Phase 1 Completion Report

## Summary
All Phase 1 features have been successfully implemented and tested for the `gh-pr` Python tool.

## Completed Features

### 1. Basic PR Fetching and Display ✅
- Fetches PR data from GitHub API
- Displays PR header with title, status, author, and file statistics
- Works with PR numbers, URLs, and owner/repo#number formats
- Auto-detects PR from current branch when no argument provided

**Test Command:**
```bash
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr
```

### 2. Comment Filtering System ✅
The following filter modes are implemented:
- **Default (unresolved)**: Shows unresolved comments on current code
- **--all**: Shows all comments regardless of resolution status
- **--resolved-active**: Shows resolved comments on current code
- **--unresolved-outdated**: Shows unresolved comments on outdated code (likely fixed)
- **--current-unresolved**: Shows only unresolved comments on current code

**Test Commands:**
```bash
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr              # Default: unresolved
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr --all        # All comments
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr --unresolved-outdated  # Unresolved on outdated code
```

### 3. Code Context Display ✅
- Shows diff hunks alongside comments for context
- Displays line numbers and file paths
- Can be disabled with `--no-code` flag
- Context lines configurable with `-c/--context` (default: 3, range: 0-50)

**Test Commands:**
```bash
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr              # Shows code context
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr --no-code    # Hides code context
gh-pr 1 -r Raudbjorn/gh-pr -c 10        # Shows 10 context lines
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **CLI Module** (`src/gh_pr/cli.py`): Command-line interface with Click
2. **PR Manager** (`src/gh_pr/core/pr_manager.py`): PR fetching and parsing logic
3. **Comment Processor** (`src/gh_pr/core/comments.py`): Thread organization with SHA256 hashing
4. **Comment Filter** (`src/gh_pr/core/filters.py`): Filter mode implementations
5. **Display Manager** (`src/gh_pr/ui/display.py`): Rich terminal output formatting

### Resolved Issues
All issues from PR reviews have been addressed:
- Thread key collisions fixed with SHA256 hashing
- Datetime parsing improved with proper fallback
- Outdated detection handles all position cases
- Suggestion regex captures all formats
- Security vulnerabilities fixed
- Code quality improvements implemented

## Verification
Created test PR #6 to verify all functionality works correctly on a real PR.

## Next Steps
Phase 1 is complete. Ready for Phase 2 features:
- Interactive UI with Textual
- Advanced filtering options
- Export functionality
- Automation features
